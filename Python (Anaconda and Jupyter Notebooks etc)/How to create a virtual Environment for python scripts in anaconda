1. First Open Anaconda Prompt and run the following command to create a new virtual environment 
	conda create --name powerbi_python python=3       # 	here 'powerbi_python' is the name of our new environment
2. Next activate the environment by the following command
	conda activate powerbi_python
3. Once it is activated with out any errors, we have to install each and every library that our python script may be using. It is done by the following command
	pip install pandas                                             #  here i wanted to install pandas 
4. For Finding out the location of our newly created enviroment, it is usually placed in the following location on our computer
	C:\Users\fahad.yousuf\Anaconda3\envs\powerbi_python
